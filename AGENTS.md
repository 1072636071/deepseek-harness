# AGENTS.md

DeepSeek Harness is an all-plugin Cordis agent harness. Read [docs/architecture.md](docs/architecture.md) before changing `packages/`; follow [docs/AGENTS.md](docs/AGENTS.md) for documentation.

## Pre-stable APIs and released Session data

Public APIs are pre-stable; update every consumer. Follow [version/status](docs/session-format-status.md) and [type acknowledgements](docs/cookbook/reviewing-persistence-type-changes.md). [Adjacent migration](.agents/notes/implemented/architecture/2026-08-31-released-session-format-migrations.md) may add a version-named successor but never move, overwrite, or delete committed generations; predecessors imply neither fallback nor downgrade support. SQLite uses monotonic `SCHEMA_VERSION`.

Acknowledge [declared persistence-type changes](docs/cookbook/reviewing-persistence-type-changes.md).

Record each externally perceptible breaking change immediately in an [upgrade guide](.agents/skills/dsh-create-upgrade-guide/SKILL.md).

**Application launch.** Only `dsh` profiles launch supported Node apps; package bins, demos, and public SDK argv escapes are forbidden ([rule](docs/architecture.md#application-launch)).

## Commands

```sh
pnpm install            # pnpm workspaces, node ^22.19 || >=24
pnpm run clean           # remove build outputs and safe residue from deleted packages
pnpm run test           # unit tests
pnpm run test:coverage  # CI coverage gate: per-file 100% on packages/*/*/src
pnpm run test:e2e       # real-API tests; self-skip without DEEPSEEK_API_KEY
pnpm run test:expected  # owner-local process expectations
pnpm run test:snapshot  # keyless recorded-session replay through shipped profiles; filter: -t <name>
pnpm run test:snapshot:record  # re-record expected outputs (needs key)
pnpm run typecheck
pnpm run lint
pnpm run duplication    # cross-file TypeScript clone detection
pnpm run build          # build:artifacts + build:check, concurrently
pnpm run build:artifacts # artifacts: tsc emits lib/types, tsdown bundles runtime, Web
pnpm run build:check    # typecheck aggregate tests/scripts against current build:artifacts output
pnpm run hygiene        # publint + workspace/package/dependency checks + NodeNext consumer check
pnpm run check:windows-wine  # ONLY when diagnosing a known Windows failure (needs wine); CI owns this signal
pnpm run doc-sync       # documentation gates (scripts/run-gates.ts)

pnpm run demo:ptc -- "task"  # headless PTC mode run (needs key)
pnpm run dev:web | dev:desktop  # build:artifacts, then launch; Web also rebuilds client bundles on edits. start:web | start:desktop skip the build
make web|dev-web|desktop|dev-desktop|build  # the same commands; ARGS='--no-open' forwards options
```

### Host sandbox failures

If a required `gh`, `pnpm`, build, test, or generator command fails because the sandbox blocks credentials, network, IPC, watching, or nested `sandbox-exec`, retry unchanged with the narrowest host escalation. Require sandbox evidence; never bypass test failures or the product sandbox.

### Run relevant checks locally

Before pushing, follow [dsh-pre-push-checks](.agents/skills/dsh-pre-push-checks/SKILL.md); report only commands run. After `gh stack sync`, validate immediately; do not merge before checks pass.

- Match evidence to the surface: focused behavior tests, model/user-output snapshots, `doc-sync` for docs, built smokes for published paths, and real-API e2e for providers.
- Never default to the full suite or repeat a passing check for commit or push. CI owns exhaustive coverage and the platform matrix; rehearse all locally only by explicit request, for CI diagnosis, or for an irreducibly repository-wide change.
- `test:coverage`, not `test`, is the CI coverage gate ([why](docs/testing.md)).
- Develop with `build:artifacts`; before claiming completion, run `build:check` after the latest `build:artifacts`, or `build` ([layout](docs/development.md#typescript-project-layout)).
- **Web browser automation and GIF recording:** launch with `pnpm dsh web --patch apps/web/tests/pin-browse-picker.overlay.yml` to use the [in-page directory picker](apps/web/tests/pin-browse-picker.overlay.yml); omit this override only when testing native picker behavior explicitly.

## Secrets / .env

Windows packaging/signing: [required reading](apps/desktop/windows-signing/README.md).

Real-API tests/demos read `DEEPSEEK_API_KEY`, optional `DEEPSEEK_BASE_URL`, and root `.env`. cordis.yml allows `!!js` (never `!js`) under plugin `config` and entry `disabled`; other metadata stays literal, so conditional composition also uses overlays ([primer](docs/cordis-primer.md#loader-configuration)). Never commit credentials. CI e2e skips without a key; [testing.md](docs/testing.md) owns key policy.

## Conventions

- Packages use `@deepseek-ai/dsh-<name>`; vendor is [rescoped](docs/rescope.md) and `private: true`. Harness packages declare `@deepseek-ai/cordis` in `peerDependencies`/`devDependencies`. Workspace dependency sections use DSH `workspace:*`, vendor/native `workspace:~` ([rules](.agents/notes/implemented/process/2026-08-10-npm-release-sequences.md)).
- ESM everywhere (`"type": "module"`). Use package names across packages and `.ts` in local relative imports. Config subprocesses run built `lib/` under plain Node; source regressions use their declared launcher ([testing policy](docs/testing.md#test-subprocess-launch-modes)). The `dsh` CLI source launch runs through tsx's ESM-only hook (`node --import tsx/esm`); modules it reaches must stay ESM (no CJS-only exports) ([source-launch contract](.agents/notes/implemented/architecture/2026-07-29-dsh-source-launch-tsx-esm.md)). Raw/Web `cordis.yml` bare plugins must appear in their resolver manifest's `dependencies`; `verify-cordis-config` enforces it.
- **Registrations are effects**: every contribution goes through `ctx.effect()` / `ctx.on()`; a registry's `register()` returns the disposer.
- **Typed events use declaration merging** and merge-extensible maps. Event JSDoc needs `@mode` and payload `@param`. Public service methods document parameters and non-void returns. `SessionEventMap` members are required-on-read unless the envelope carries `ignorable: true`. Bump `SESSION_FORMAT_VERSION` only when existing discriminators cannot prevent unsafe interpretation; same-version changes require safe reader behavior ([review](.agents/notes/implemented/process/2026-10-08-session-reader-compatibility-review.md)).
- **Switch on discriminant tags.** Closed unions end in `assertNever`; merge-extensible unions fall through a documented default.
- **Waterfall listeners MUST call `next()`** to delegate; returning without it short-circuits the chain ([semantics](docs/cordis-primer.md#cordis-waterfall-semantics)).
- **Model-visible ⟺ logged**: anything that reaches a model request must be reconstructable from the session log; a new model-visible input requires a session event.
- **Plugins, not loop changes**: new behavior goes on documented extension points; changing `agent-loop` requires updating docs/architecture.md.
- **A capability seam comprises Service Definition / Service Provider / Consumer roles.** It is complete, never one role; split only when roles evolve independently ([glossary](docs/glossary.md#capability-seam)).
- **Prefer maintained dependencies over hand-rolling** when they genuinely delete owned code and tests ([policy](.agents/notes/implemented/process/2026-07-26-dependencies-over-hand-rolling.md)).
- **Explicit > implicit at package boundaries**: defaulting is an explicit `resolve(request): Spec` step in the owning implementation, never a hidden `?? default` inside `run()` (the `dsh-shell` request/spec split is the template).
- **No hardcoded tunables in plugins**: deployment-varying choices are validated `Config` fields changeable from cordis.yml; a `DEFAULT_*` constant or test hook is not configurability. Protocol constants, external specs, and security invariants stay fixed.
- **Misconfiguration fails loud** at load when self-contained, otherwise at the earliest resolvable point; never silently skip a missing referent.
- **Opaque cross-boundary ids are branded** (`Branded<B>` from `dsh-brand`), never bare `string`.
- **Trust TypeScript at typed same-process boundaries.** Do not add runtime validation, fallback behavior, or hostile-input tests solely for values the static interface requires; validate at parser/config, queued, model/tool JSON, durable/file, worker, process, and wire boundaries.
- **No new assertions to `unknown`** (`as unknown` or `<unknown>`). Preserve or reduce the exact legacy baseline; use typed values or validation for replacements ([rule](.agents/notes/implemented/process/2026-09-19-no-unknown-casts.md)).
- **Source plane vs artifact plane, never mixed.** Static gates and tests resolve workspace imports through tsconfig `paths` to `src` and pass on a clean tree; gates consuming built `lib/` declare that dependency ([layout](docs/development.md#typescript-project-layout)).
- **Keep compiler faces explicit.** A package with both Host and Client programs exposes face-specific leaf configs and a solution-only root; repo-wide programs seed a face config, never the root solution ([layout](docs/development.md#typescript-project-layout)).
- **Error handling:** use typed, structured failures and localized, actionable reports. Define handling ownership, containment, and failure guarantees; stop dependent work and visibly report untrusted state or unknown outcomes. Follow [dsh-error-handling](.agents/skills/dsh-error-handling/SKILL.md).
- **An empty `catch` names the error** and why; keep its `try` to one statement.
- **Keep comments local.** Do not restate code, expand unrelated comments, or explain distant behavior without local need ([rationale](.agents/skills/dsh-prose-standard/SKILL.md)).
- **Ban `prove` + `nance`** ([rule](.agents/notes/implemented/process/2026-08-26-ban-ambiguous-origin-label.md)).
- **Prefer symmetry for parallel values**; unexplained asymmetry usually signals a missed extraction.
- **Tests describe behavior, not correctness.** Change obsolete behavior with its tests; explain why in the PR.
- **Create Agent Notes only for durable decision rationale;** mechanical/local edits are exempt, including local UI changes ([scope](.agents/notes/README.md#when-to-write-one)). Archived notes are frozen: never edit or treat them as current authority ([archive policy](.agents/notes/README.md#archiving-and-deletion)).
- **Official plugin artwork:** use [dsh-official-plugin-artwork](.agents/skills/dsh-official-plugin-artwork/SKILL.md) for official and official experimental plugin icons; obtain designer approval before landing new glyphs.
- **Client UI copy is locale-owned.** Route product text through typed dictionaries and `t` or localized primitive props; `verify-client-ui-i18n` rejects hardcoded copy ([decision](.agents/notes/implemented/architecture/2026-08-23-locale-owned-client-ui-copy.md)).
- **Testing policy** — [docs/testing.md](docs/testing.md). Every non-trivial model- or product-user-visible change updates a keyless recorded-session snapshot; [snapshot ownership](snapshots/AGENTS.md) reserves the top-level tree for session-driven cases and keeps other expected output owner-local. Fixtures replay on macOS/Linux; fix fixtures, not normalizers.
- **Design each tool's UI presentation up front.** Host presenters stay pure; Web cards derive from raw events and persisted result metadata ([cookbook](docs/cookbook/adding-a-tool.md)).
- **Plan unit, e2e, and snapshot coverage** for capability seams, lifecycle paths, and transcript output; include missing snapshot-harness support in the same change.
- **Locally linked DSH plugins:** after each DSH upgrade, re-check every in-house `link:`-installed plugin in `~/.dsh/profiles/web`; skip when that profile does not exist ([roster](docs/自定义插件/自研DSH插件名录.md)).
- **Both SDKs project the loop.** Agent-loop, session-lifecycle, and `SessionEventMap` changes update the TypeScript and Python SDK expected outputs in the same PR; `pnpm run test` covers neither ([surfaces](docs/testing.md#when-a-snapshot-test-is-required)).
- **Choose PR history deliberately.** Split independent changes and fix the introducing PR before propagation. Standalone/stack branches may merge-forward or rebase. Rewrites use `--force-with-lease`, abort on remote movement, never raw `--force`; preserve an in-progress merge-forward checkpoint before taking a newer base ([rationale](.agents/notes/implemented/process/2026-08-02-native-github-stacks-and-optional-rebases.md)).
- **Labels:** one PR `kind/*`, all material `area/*`, and native Issue Type ([taxonomy](.agents/notes/implemented/process/2026-08-08-unified-github-label-taxonomy.md)).
- TODO markers: `FIXME`/`TODO`/`XXX` by urgency ([semantics](docs/development.md)).
- Files end with exactly one trailing newline; `git diff --cached --check` (pre-commit) gates it.

## Defensive patterns

Read [docs/defensive-patterns/README.md](docs/defensive-patterns/README.md) before changing a package surface, remote service, client component or state, conversation or Session behavior, or lifecycle, concurrency, subprocess, and teardown code. Its [review principles](docs/defensive-patterns/README.md#why-these-rules) apply per artifact.

## Type safety and documentation

Everything compiles under `strict: true` with `noImplicitAny`; every remaining `any` explains why narrowing is infeasible. Every module and export has concise JSDoc for its non-obvious contract; function-like exports include `@param`/`@returns`, as enforced by `verify-export-jsdoc`. Heritage-declared members, plugin-protocol slots, and constructors keep their docs at the declaring Service Definition, protocol, or class.

Comments and docs state complete contracts and context, not reasoning transcripts. Use direct, concrete terms, no metaphors; before writing `contract`, `boundary`, or `shape`, name the subject exactly (`response fields`, `JSON validation`, `ESM exports`). Keep `contract` for preconditions, postconditions, invariants, compatibility promises, and other obligations callers, callees, implementers, providers, producers, or consumers rely on. Keep a literal process, wire, security, transaction, or lifecycle boundary. Keep behavior, failure, timing, ownership, and safe-use facts; link the rationale. Do not narrate control flow or tests, preserve review history, or restate code. Use [dsh-prose-standard](.agents/skills/dsh-prose-standard/SKILL.md) for decisions. Wire mechanically checkable invariants into an executed top-level gate and prove each changed acceptance path rejects an invalid case. Use narrow, justified exceptions instead of disabling a rule globally.

Docs accompany every code change: update affected README and JSDoc contracts together. Routine bilingual work follows [docs/AGENTS.md](docs/AGENTS.md); only explicit user invocation may run `dsh-translate-docs`. Current-state prose, one physical line per paragraph, one home per fact, and word budgets live there.

## Editing these instructions

`CLAUDE.md` symlinks `AGENTS.md` at root and `packages/`; edit the real file. Keep each rule self-contained while linking high-level docs. Condense when clarity survives; raise a `verify-doc-budgets` ceiling when the required content genuinely needs more space.

## Vendoring policy

`vendor/` packages are pinned source copies (manifest with upstream SHAs in [vendor/README.md](vendor/README.md)). Update via the sync procedure there; re-apply or retire the logged local modifications; rerun `pnpm run test && pnpm run build`.
